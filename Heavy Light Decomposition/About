During 2nd year 1st semester final exam , I have learnt the HLD approach. I think , it is one of the most important topics that i have learnt during any exam.
But for this, I have to waste a lot of time for silly mistake of mine. HLD code is normally around 150 lines. Debugginga a such size of codes
is most painful task to me. That's why during debugging I couldn't give my full concentration on it. About 24 hours time I did nothing without sleeping or youtubing / facebooking and try to debug this code.
But I think , giving a large amount of time behind gives me a clear conception about differents pros and cons about HLD codes.
